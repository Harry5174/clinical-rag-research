You had a cardiac catheterization that showed the coronaries were clean, but you had mild anterolateral and mid inferior hypokinesis of the left ventricle. We are unsure what caused these findings, but are concerned that you either had an obstruction that resolved or a coronary vasospasm. You were feeling better, and we started you on a low dose of Metoprolol. You should have cardiology follow up, which Dr. set up. You should additionally have a repeat cardiac echo and can consider having your cardiologist order a cardiac MRI for you within the next two weeks to further evaluate for possible myocardial infarction. If you would like to schedule this here, the phone number is . We have also sent the cardiac MRI department an email to notify that you may be calling in the next week to set this up. If you decide not to make this appointment please call to let them know.

NG lavage was performed and clear. He received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (2 on and 2 on with stable hematocrit and no further episodes of melena. He was treated with a Protonix drip, transitioned to IV bid. The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement). Ultimately, the patient and his HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation. Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no definitive intervention was done. His need for Plavix was discussed with his PCP, and he was determined to no longer need this medication. He was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge and transitioned to twice daily oral PPI. He will be on this medication for two months and then can transition to once daily. Hypoxia/IPF/COPD: The patient's hypoxia was likely multifactorial and was thought to be due to ARDS in addition to his COPD and IPF. The patient's steroid taper had finished on (after\",\n",
